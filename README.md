# Advent of Code 2023

ðŸŽ… Solutions for Advent of Code 2023 written in TypeScript.

I'm using [Bun](https://bun.sh) this year. Find instructions to install the Bun executable [here](https://bun.sh/docs/installation).

## Set Up

Install the dependencies using Bun.

```bash
bun install
```

Create a `.env` file at the root that contains your Advent `session` cookie. You can find this cookie value by inspecting the network request made to `https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/DAY_NUMBER/input` in the browser.

```bash
# .env

ADVENT_SESSION=YOUR_SESSION_COOKIE
```

## Scaffolding Each Day

I've provided a `scaffold` `package.json` script that will set up the files needed for solving both parts for each day, as well as pulling your unique input. It will output them in a `solutions/DAY_NUMBER` directory.

The first argument should be the day number and the remaining arguments should be the words in the day's title. The title argument is optional.

```bash
# The following will create a solutions/01 directory and place all necessary files there.
# It will also replace the recap.md title placeholder with "The First Day"

bun scaffold 1 The First Day
```

## Solving Each Day

Run the `solve` `package.json` script to execute the solution code for a given day.

```bash
bun solve 1
```
